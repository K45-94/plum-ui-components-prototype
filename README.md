# plumV3 (plum)

Building Plum with vue 3. This app is getting complex and I thought I could redesign and rebuild it better with Vue 3
Finally found a way for nesting child pages in routes.
Optimizing mobile/small-screen view before we jump to large-screen view.
So far, any one can fork this template and use it for your vue projects. Contact through kelvinhiuhu@live.com
